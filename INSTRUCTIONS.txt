First of all, you need to set-up your environment to be able to send e-mails.
To do so, edit the file "config.sh" and set your e-mail and password.

After that, in the same shell session you'll execute the project itself, use:
$ source config.sh

Now you're ready to go. Use "$ ./gradlew run" and be happy.

NOTE: you have to enable third-part apps to use your gmail account (if it's a
gmail account). You'll receive an e-mail from google reporting the attempt to
use your e-mail, in that e-mail you'll be able to enable third-part apps.
