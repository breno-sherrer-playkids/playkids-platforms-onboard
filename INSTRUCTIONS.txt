First of all, you need to set-up your environment to be able to send e-mails.
To do so, edit the file "config.sh" and set your e-mail and password.

After that, in the same shell session you'll execute the project itself, use:
$ source ./config.sh

Now you're ready to go. Use "$ ./gradlew run" and be happy.
