First of all, you need to set-up your environment to be able to send e-mails.
To do so, edit the file "config.sh" and set your e-mail and password.

After that, in the same shell session you'll execute the project itself, use:
$ source config.sh

You'll need to create a Postgres database named 'playkids-onboard-lottery'
(exactly) with the structure defined in the file:

playkids-platforms-onboard-api-model/src/main/kotlin/com/playkids/onboard/model/persistent/schema.sql

Now you're ready to go. Use "$ ./gradlew run" and be happy.

NOTE: you have to enable third-part apps to use your gmail account (if it's a
gmail account). You'll receive an e-mail from google reporting the attempt to
use your e-mail, in that e-mail you'll be able to enable third-part apps.

NOTE 2: PostgreSQL user has to be postgres with the password 'root'. If you need another
password, change the file:

playkids-platforms-onboard-api-model/src/main/kotlin/com/playkids/onboard/model/persistent/DatabaseConfigurator.kt

NOTE 3: To create a Lottery, you can use the api (/api/lottery POST) or directly via database insert as the
frontend has no entries to create a Lottery.
